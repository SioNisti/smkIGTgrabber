this program is supposed to take a picture of the in game timer after a race and copy that time to your clipboard so you can easily paste it into livesplit instead of frantically typing it out after a race.

# BUT
no matter what i cant get ironocr to recognize the text. pls contribute if you find this and think you can fix it.
